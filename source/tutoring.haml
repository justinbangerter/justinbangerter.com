    ##Tutoring in Roanoke, VA

    ###What to Expect

    I have tutored math, chemistry, and physics to kids, teenagers, and adults since 2003.
    I ask a lot of questions and use various techniques to encourage active recall, which is proven to help students retain information.
    My goal is not to lecture you for an hour.
    My goal is to guide you as you develop new skills and overcome whatever stands in your way.

    Sessions are $45 per hour. The first hour of the first session is $20.

    I hold most sessions at the [Barnes and Noble on Electric Road by the Tanglewood Mall in Roanoke.](https://stores.barnesandnoble.com/store/2870)
    If you would like to meet somewhere else, please ask.

    When you contact me, tell me about your goals (study for a test, improve grade, etc...) and availability.

    During the first hour,
    we will work together and come up with a plan to get you where you want to be.

    Bring any homework, quizzes, or material that you would like to review.

    I look forward to working with you!
